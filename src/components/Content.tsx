        <h3>About Rock, Paper and Scissors</h3>
        <p className="description">
          It is a simple hand game played between two people where each player
          forms one of three hand signs: rock, paper, or scissors. The objective
          is to choose a sign that defeats the other player's sign based on a
          set of rules. It is typically played in a best-of-three format and can
          be played by anyone, anywhere, without any special equipment.
